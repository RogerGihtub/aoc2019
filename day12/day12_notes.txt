Advent of Code 2019: Day 12

Part 01 is surprisingly-sane, really.

The main trickery here is ensuring all the steps happen in the right order
for everyone.  Ample use of "put this calculated thing into a pending bucket"
and "okay now apply things out of the pending bucket" helped.

Part 02... I dunno.

I mean, okay, Experiment_1 shows that there's sort of a "resonance" going on,
with moons 1 and 3 repeating every 924 turns, and that repeats 3 times to get
us to 2772.

So what do I *do* with that?

well... I could pre-gen/load the states up to that point, I guess.  That
would speed things up somewhat.  Would it speed them up enough?  Hrm.
Maybe.

I guess I'll figure out the resonances for each moon in the 'big number'
systems, assuming I can do so in less than a week each, and maybe that
will be enough to get me where I need to go.  Maybe.

There might be some other optimizations to try to pull here, but let's see
if this seems to be on the right path at least.

4 686 774 924

4686774924/100124388 doesn't resonate so hrm what why.
