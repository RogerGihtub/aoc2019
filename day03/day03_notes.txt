Advent of Code 2019: Day 03

Let the brutally-inefficient brute-force brutery commence.

This was the first hint that using 'real' two-dimensional arrays was
going to be a bad idea, but I didn't listen (yet.)

Instead, I just plowed along with 
var grid = new string[20480, 20480];

To be fair, using wire-specific char ("A" and "B") to distinguish
between the two wires was marginally-clever.  It made it easier to walk
the wires later, and also to distinguish between a wire crossing itself
and a wire crossing the other wire.

Also check out my personal very-common pattern of "Okay, they're asking for
the minimum or maximum thing here, so we're just gonna look at all the things."

ALSO you can see that I sort-of defensively try to check for error conditions,
but then don't actually do anything with them.

So, yes, could be optimized, but why.
