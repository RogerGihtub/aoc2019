Advent of Code 2019: Day 04

Let the brutally-inefficient brute-force brutery continue!

A bit of a breather, easier day.

This sort of very verbose, very explicit, not clever at all really, code
is just fine in my books and I think I wouldn't touch it very much unless
I had to.

It probably wouldn't work all that well if the passwords were a hundred
characters long, but they're not, so I don't care.
