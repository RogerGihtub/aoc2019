Advent of Code 2019: Day 08

Not too hard.  Some stolen StackExchange code helped though.

Part 01 in particular is very straightforward.

Part 02 was mostly straightforward; the main trickery was to start on the bottom
layer and work your way up to the top.

The other slightly clever bit was basically not worrying about line length at all
during the painting; just crammed all the painted tiles together.  Since I already
had a routine to break that into lines, I used that again.  So that was nice.

Apparently some other people managed to mirror and/or invert the letters, which
doesn't especially surprise me I guess.
